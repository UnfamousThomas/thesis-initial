# GameType

A **GameType** represents a scalable container for one or more fleets, enabling the management and upgrading of server versions. It serves as the central unit for scaling and versioning of game server deployments.

### Manifest

The manifest for a **GameType** object looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: network.unfamousthomas.me/v1alpha1
kind: GameType
metadata:
  name: gametype-sample
spec:
  fleetSpec: # The specification for the fleet associated with this GameType
    scaling:
      replicas: 3 # The number of replicas (servers) to maintain
      prioritizeAllowed: true # Whether to delete allowed servers first when downscaling
      agePriority: oldest_first # Whether to prioritize deleting oldest or newest servers when scaling down
    spec: # The spec for the servers within this fleet (same as a Server object spec)
      timeout: 5m
      allowForceDelete: false # Whether to allow forceful deletion without user consent
      pod:
        containers:
          - name: example-container
            image: nginx:latest
            ports:
              - containerPort: 80
                protocol: TCP
            resources:
              limits:
                cpu: "500m"
                memory: "256Mi"
              requests:
                cpu: "250m"
                memory: "128Mi"
```

### Purpose

The **GameType** object currently acts as a wrapper for 1-2 fleets. While its manifest closely mirrors the **Fleet** object, it provides the additional role of handling multiple fleet versions. This allows for gradual upgrades or changes in server configurations, with the flexibility to roll out new fleet versions in a controlled manner.

### Upgrade Process

When the pod spec (the configuration of the containers) for the servers changes, the GameType initiates the following process:
* **Create New Fleet**: A new fleet is created with the same number of replicas and the updated spec.

* **Gradual Upgrade**:  The old fleet is gradually removed according to the server deletion rules set in the fleet (e.g., prioritizing allowed deletions or age-based deletions).

* **Trigger Old Fleet Deletion**: Once the new fleet is running and stable, the old fleet is triggered for deletion, again adhering to the server's deletion policies.

This ensures a smooth upgrade process, minimizing downtime and adhering to the configured server policies.

### Future Changes
The **GameType** spec may evolve in the future to provide more advanced scaling or versioning capabilities. However, for now, it functions as a simple container for one or two fleets, with the primary goal of supporting controlled upgrades and scaling of game servers.
